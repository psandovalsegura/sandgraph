        <p>I started programming on graphing calculators like the TI-83 (which I still use today).</p>
        <p>Attempting to replicate it's firmware, I wrote a program in Java which could plot single variable functions
           on the cartesian plane. The graphing of the function relies on evaluating the function at discrete x and y values
           which are determined through the variable <i>accuracyIndex</i>.<p>
        <p>Below we try plotting <i>y(x) = sin(x) + x</i></p>
        <p>For example, an <i>accuracyIndex</i> of 20.0 produces: </p>

        <p>While an <i>accuracyIndex</i> of 1.0 produces: </p>

        <p>The <i>GraphWindow</i> class relies on the <i>java.awt.*</i> and <i>java.swing.*</i> packages. The
        window, panel, and drawing functions are in the classes within those packages.</p>
        <p>The difficulty designing a graphing simulator has to do with scaling the axis depending on window
        size. Which window size are we talking about? Both of them: the window you can set to full screen, and the
        window of the x-y plane (which has a min/max range). </p>

        <p>Adjusting the ranges, we can visualize a gaussian curve with variance Ïƒ = 0.846</p>
